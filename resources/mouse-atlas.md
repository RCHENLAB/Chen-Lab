# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Mouse Retina Atlas

A unified single-cell atlas of the mouse retina using the most comprehensive approximately 250,000 single cells from our in-house experiments complementing public datasets. Cell labeling of 11 major types and over 120 subtypes form a unified single-cell reference for the mouse retina.

[A table of the gene expression values for BC subclassesâ€™ pseudo bulk](https://rchenlab.github.io/resources/files/MouseRetinaAtlas_BCsubclass_pseudobulk_median_symbol.xlsx). Each value is the median of normalized expressions among samples in the meta datasets for BC subclasses pseudo bulk (i.e., FPKM values).
