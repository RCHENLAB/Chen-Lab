## Single cell RNA sequencing
#### Postdocs to uncover the genetic code of human diseases

We are recruiting audacious postdocs to uncover the genetic code of human diseases. We aim at systematically characterize the genetic variants, coding and noncoding, underlying human visual disorders. We integrate next generation sequencing, single cell omics, patient derived iPSC and retinal organoid, mice and non-human primate models, and machine learning and deep learning technologies approach to iteratively improve our ability to identify, assess, and predict the function of genetic variants in the context of human diseases.  Applicants with experiences in human genetics, genomics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, machine learning are most welcome.
