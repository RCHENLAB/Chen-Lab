# <i class="fas fa-users"></i>Human Retina Atlas

A single cell atlas of the human retina that is composed of 2.5 million single cells from 48 donors has been generated by combining previously published and newly generated datasets. As a result, over 90 distinct cell types are identified based on the transcriptomics profile with the rarest cell type accounting forabout 0.01% of the cell population. In addition, open chromatin profiling has been generated for over 400K nuclei via single nuclei ATAC-seq, allowing systematic characterization of cis-regulatory elements for individualcell type. Integrative analysis reveals intriguing differences in the transcriptome, chromatin landscape, and gene regulatory network among cell class, subgroup, and type. In addition, changes in cell proportion, gene expression and chromatin openness have been observed between different gender and over age.
