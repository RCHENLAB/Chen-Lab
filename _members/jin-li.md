Dr. Jin Li has been in the Chen lab since Jan 2021. He got his bachelor's and master’s degrees in computer science in China, and he obtained his Ph.D. degree in bioinformatics from Texas A&M University in 2018. Before joining Dr. Chen’s lab, Jin worked on epigenetic data analysis of bisulfite-sequencing for one year and a half as a postdoc at the Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University. Dr. Jin Li is working on single-cell genomics for the human and mouse eye. He is currently constructing a human eye cell atlas using multi-modal datasets. This atlas will characterize various cell types across different parts of the human eye using single-cell transcriptomic data and will identify the regulatory elements underlying these cell types through single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling. The expected outcome is to provide a unified single-cell reference for the human eye to benefit the vision science community.
