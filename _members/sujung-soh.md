Sujung Soh is a postdoctoral associate who joined Chen's lab in January 2024. She received her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from Sookmyung Womenâ€™s University, Republic of Korea, in 2023. Her dissertation investigated the impact of Adiponectin on the migratory ability of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. In the Chen lab, her research is focused on two main areas: 1) investigating the role of the retinoic acid pathway in macular development and 2) understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the transition of primary retinal progenitor cells during development.
