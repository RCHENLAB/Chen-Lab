Meng Wang has been in Chen Lab since December 2019. She received her Bachelor’s Degree from University of Science and Technology of China in Optical Information Science & Technology in 2015 and her Master's Degree in Physics from Illinois Institute of Technology in 2017. She is currently working on research in human genetics on inherited retinal disease (IRDs) and single-cell genomics using the visual system as a model. Her work involves profiling mRNA alternative splicing events in various retina cell types, particularly in the context of aging. A complete catalog of splicing isoforms at the single-cell level could guide the accurate prediction of the effect of genetic variants in disorders related to the retina. Additionally, she is intensely interested in genetics perturbation and aims to refine existing methods and develop new tools using foundation models to enhance the prediction of the outcomes of unseen chemical and genetic perturbations on single cells. This work seeks to expand our understanding of the biological mechanisms and benefit the treatment of genetic disorders. She’s also working to develop multiple databases and user interfaces that can be applied to our project's daily use.
