Meng Wang is a Bioinformatics Programmer in the Department of Molecular & Human Genetics and she joined Chen Lab in December of 2019. She received her Bachelor’s Degree from University of Science and Technology of China in Optical Information Science & Technology in 2015 and her Master's Degree in Physics from Illinois Institute of Technology in 2017. Meng’s research in Chen Lab mainly focuses on 3 topics: 1) human genetics research of Inherited Retinal Diseases (IRDs) using WGS;  2) cell-level gene isoform detection using ONT long read single cell RNA sequencing; 3) detection and validation of structural variations. She’s also working to develop multiple databases and user interfaces which can be applied to our project daily use.
