It is excited to announce our project was presented as awarded project at 2022 Translational Research Acceleration Program (TRAP)[https://www.fightingblindness.org/translational-research-acceleration-program#2022-trap-awardees-webinar-1332].

The Translational Research Acceleration Program (TRAP) awards will accelerate the movement of preclinical research toward an Investigational New Drug filing and into clinical trials to provide a robust and diverse pipeline of potential therapies to fight inherited retinal degenerations (IRD) and dry age-related macular degeneration.

Our Project Title: Retinal Regeneration Through Epigenetic Therapy
Our Project Summary: This project strives to research, develop, and optimize a novel approach to activate retinal MÃ¼ller glial cell reprogramming through genetic manipulation in effort to generate new photoreceptor cells. A promising alternative for cell transplantation therapy is reprogramming endogenous cells in the retina to induce neural regeneration. It is known that some species, such as fish and birds, can regrow neural cells after retinal injury and restore visual function. However, this biological process has been suppressed in humans. Therefore, it is hypothesized that if the regeneration program can be reactivated and controlled properly, it would serve as an ideal therapeutic approach.
