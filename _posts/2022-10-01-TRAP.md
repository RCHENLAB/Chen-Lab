Rui Chen (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) – Project Title: Retinal Regeneration Through Epigenetic Therapy
Project Summary: This project strives to research, develop, and optimize a novel approach to activate retinal Müller glial cell reprogramming through genetic manipulation in effort to generate new photoreceptor cells. A promising alternative for cell transplantation therapy is reprogramming endogenous cells in the retina to induce neural regeneration. It is known that some species, such as fish and birds, can regrow neural cells after retinal injury and restore visual function. However, this biological process has been suppressed in humans. Therefore, it is hypothesized that if the regeneration program can be reactivated and controlled properly, it would serve as an ideal therapeutic approach.
