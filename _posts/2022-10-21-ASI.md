The [Anterior Segment Initiative](https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/goals-and-accomplishments/nei-research-initiatives/anterior-segment-initiative/asi-ocular-surface-innervation-consortia) under National Eye Institute has funded eight research projects to explore the innervation of the eyeâ€™s surface. It is exciting to announce that our lab is involved in one of the projects "[Effects of cornea epithelial barrier disruption on the cornea trigeminal neural circuit](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10586519)".

Corneal nerve ends closely integrate with the corneal epithelial layers. Our lab will collaborate to investigate how disruptions to the corneal epithelial barrier influence corneal nerve health. In a rodent model of dry eye disease, the team will test whether preserving the corneal epithelial barrier prevents corneal signaling cascades that cause nerve damage.
