{% capture text %} Jin presented his poster "Single cell atlas of the human retina" during [The Biology of Genomes 2022](https://meetings.cshl.edu/abstracts.aspx?meet=GENOME&year=22) from May 10 to May 14.

Single-cell technologies have become powerful tools for studying cellular components, transcriptome relationships, and regulatory mechanisms underlying various retinal diseases and biological processes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has advanced the assessment of cellular heterogeneity by detecting transcriptional similarities and differences at single cell resolution. 

We have collected the most comprehensive of 2 million single cells for adult human retina. The cell atlas contains 10 major cell types and over 100 subtypes. The resulting cell labeling forms a single-cell reference of the human retina. The reference has been shared at [cellxgene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/af893e86-8e9f-41f1-a474-ef05359b1fb7). This single cell atlas yields a valuable data resource of the human retina for the field.
