{% capture text %} Jin presented his poster "Single cell atlas of the human retina" during [The Biology of Genomes 2022](https://meetings.cshl.edu/abstracts.aspx?meet=GENOME&year=22) from May 10 to May 14.

We have collected the most comprehensive of 2 million single cells for adult human retina. The cell atlas contains 10 major cell types and over 100 subtypes. The resulting cell labeling forms a single-cell reference of the human retina. The reference has been shared at cellxgene. This single cell atlas yields a valuable data resource of the human retina for the field.
