The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) Data Insights Cycle 3 grantee announcement is now [available](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/cell-science/data-insights/?cycle=3)! These projects aim to support researchers and computational experts in developing tools and resources to extract deeper insights into health and disease from existing single-cell biology datasets.

Our lab will continue collaborating with Dr. Ken Chen's team from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center on the project "Insights into the Somatic Mutation Landscape of Single-Cell Omics." This project aims to explore the somatic mutation landscape across various human normal tissues using diverse sources of single-cell omics data.
