Our lab's research, Zhen's publication titled “[Single cell dual-omic atlas of the human developing retina](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50853-5)” has been selected for inclusion in the HCA Nature Collection, "[The Human Cell Atlas: towards a first draft atlas](https://www.nature.com/collections/jccbbdahji)"

In this study, we offer a detailed single-nuclei dual-omic atlas of the human developing retina, examining around 220,000 nuclei from 14 human embryos and fetuses aged 8 to 23 weeks post-conception. This atlas encompasses both macular and peripheral tissues, capturing all major retinal cell types, as well as a significant number of progenitors and cell-type-specific precursors. Our analysis of cell trajectories reveals a shift from continuous progression in early progenitors to a more hierarchical development during later stages of cell type specification. We identify both established and novel candidate transcription factors, along with gene regulatory networks that guide the transitions of various cell fates. Notably, comparisons between macular and peripheral retinae show both consistent and distinct developmental patterns. This atlas offers unparalleled insight into the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility landscapes during retinal development, providing valuable information on retinal development and related diseases.

This collection including our manuscript exemplifies the pioneering efforts of the HCA community, showcasing groundbreaking datasets, computational tools, and biomedical discoveries. These contributions lay a strong foundation for the first draft of the Human Cell Atlas, developed by the 18 HCA Biological Networks in collaboration with the core HCA data integration team. More broadly, this collection illustrates how single-cell genomics is revolutionizing our understanding of human biology and driving both experimental and computational innovation.

This achievement has been celebrated globally, with coverage from BBC News, El Pais, CNN, The FT, Reuters, GenomeWeb, The Economist, Yahoo News, among others. The collection has generated significant excitement on social media and at scientific meetings.
