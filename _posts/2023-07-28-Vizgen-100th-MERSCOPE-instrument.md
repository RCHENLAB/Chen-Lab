Vizgen, a life science company committed to enhancing human health through the visualization of single-cell spatial genomics information, reached a significant milestone by successfully installing its 100th MERSCOPE instrument. The installation took place in the Single Cell Genomics Core at Baylor College of Medicine Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, which is under the leadership of Dr. Rui Chen. As one of the first adopters of the Alpha MERSCOPEÂ® platform, the Core relies on this advanced spatial genomics technology to gain deeper insights into the relationship between genetic variants and visual disorders.
