Science published an [article](https://www.science.org/content/article/your-cells-don-t-have-genome-you-were-born-project-aims-chart-impact-new-mutations) featuring the Somatic Mosaicism Across Human Tissues (SMaHT) program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in which our lab [participated](https://rchenlab.github.io/2023/05/11/SMaHT.html).
"For SMaHT, five groups of researchers plan to use several techniques to ferret out and verify these hidden signals. Doddapaneni, his Baylor colleague Rui Chen, and their team, for example, will deploy not just conventional whole genome DNA sequencing, but also two types of RNA sequencing, which can help confirm some variants and identify the types of cells carrying them. To weed out errors, they will also use duplex sequencing, a less common technique that decodes both strands of DNAâ€™s double helix to reduce mistakes and pinpoint rare mutations."
