It's with great enthusiasm that we share news of the $90,000 Career-Starter Research Grant awarded to Dr. Hafiz Muhammad Jafar Hussain by The Knights Templar Eye Foundation.

Dr. Hafiz Muhammad Jafar Hussain, a Postdoctoral Associate at our lab, has been awarded a substantial grant of $90,000 from The Knights Templar Eye Foundation to support his research on retinal diseases. This funding is part of the Foundation's commitment to backing researchers dedicated to the treatment and prevention of vision-impairing conditions in infants and children. Dr. Jafar's research is set to advance the understanding and potential treatment options for inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) through the exploration and functional analysis of novel candidate genes.
